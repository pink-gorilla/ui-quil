Similar to the concept\n  of harmonics in physics, perlin noise is computed over several\n  octaves which are added together for the final result.\n\n  Another way to adjust the character of the resulting sequence is the\n  scale of the input coordinates.

Only used in `:pdf` and\n                        `:svg` modes. Not supported in Clojurescript. When\n                        writing to a file, call [[exit]] at the end of the\n                        `draw` call to end the sketch and not write repeatedly\n                        to the file.\n  * `:title`          - A string which will be displayed at the top of\n                        the sketch window.

Not supported in clojurescript.\n    - `:exit-on-close` - Shutdown JVM  when sketch is closed.\n                         Not supported in Clojurescript.\n    - `:resizable`     - Makes sketch resizable. Not supported in Clojurescript.\n    - `:no-safe-fns`   - Do not catch and print exceptions thrown inside\n                         functions provided to sketch (like draw,\n                         [[mouse-pressed?]], [[key-pressed?]] and others). By\n                         default all exceptions thrown inside these functions\n                         are caught.

Not supported in\n                         Clojurescript.\n    - `:present`       - Switch to present mode (fullscreen without borders, OS\n                         panels). You may want to use this feature together with\n                         `:size :fullscreen`. Not supported in ClojureScript. In\n                         ClojureScript fullscreen is enabled by pressing F11 and\n                         it's enabled on all sketches automatically.\n    - `:no-start`      - Disables autostart if sketch was created using the\n                         [[defsketch]] macro. To start sketch you have to call\n                         function created [[defsketch]]. Supported only in\n                         ClojureScript.\n                        Usage example: `:features [:keep-on-top :present]`\n  * `:bgcolor`        - Sets background color for unused space in present mode.\n                        Color is specified in hex format for example\n                        `:bgcolor \\\"#00FFFF\\\"` (cyan background)\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:display`        - Sets what display should be used by this sketch.\n                        Displays are numbered starting from 0.\n                        Example: `:display 1`.\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:setup`          - A function to be called once when setting the sketch up.\n  * `:draw`           - A function to be repeatedly called at most n times per\n                        second where n is the target [[frame-rate]] set for\n                        the visualisation.\n  * `:host`           - String id of canvas element or DOM element itself.\n                        Specifies host for the sketch. Must be specified in\n                        sketch, may be omitted in defsketch. If omitted in\n                        [[defsketch]], `:host` is set to the name of the sketch.\n                        If element with specified id is not found on the page\n                        and page is empty, a new canvas element will be created.\n                        Used in ClojureScript.\n  * `:focus-gained`   - Called when the sketch gains focus.\n                        Not supported in ClojureScript.\n  * `:focus-lost`     - Called when the sketch loses focus.
